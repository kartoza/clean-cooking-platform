            Clean Cooking Explorer is an online, open-source, interactive
            platform that
            synthesizes and analyzes more than 20 geographic data sets on both
            energy
            supply and demand. It is a multi-criteria analysis tool that uses
            location-specific resource availability and infrastructure data to
            represent
            energy supply. It also incorporates demographic data and data on
            social and
            productive uses to visualize demand for energy services. Together,
            these
            supply and demand indicators enable more comprehensive energy
            planning. Spatial analysis tools, including multi-criteria
            analysis,
            overlays, filters and buffer zones, help users identify and
            prioritize areas
            where energy access can be expanded.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tool incorporates remote sensing data as well as data from
            global,
            national, sub-national and census databases that are either
            publicly
            available or provided by international partners and local
            stakeholders. It
            can host data available in various resolutions, scales and formats
            allowing
            for better or new datasets to be incorporated once available. The
            selection
            of data is based on a literature review and a survey WRI conducts
            on the
            importance of certain datasets in geospatial energy access
            planning. The
            list of essential data is reviewed by local stakeholders to ensure
            the
            platform is relevant and applicable in the local context.
