                If you want to carry out intelligent market based and techology
                appropriate
                planning, Clean Cooking Explorer is what you should use.

        <h4>
            Deputy Director, Energy Planning, Energy and Petroleum Regulatory
            Authority
            of Kenya
        </h4>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Clean Cooking Explorer will be critical for facilitating
                planners to access
                data on load centers, energy resource availability,
                infrastructure in a
                timely manner.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a platform that will link the stakeholders that
                generate data with
                the ones that use it. EAE is likely to become very critical
                when it comes to
                energy planning as it will take into account the spatial
                dimension of energy
                systems and will inform the other planning tools (demand
                forecasting, short
                term optimization and long term expansion) that are currently
                being used in
                Kenya.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Clean Cooking Explorer is a tool that can help the Ministry of
                Health assess
                the best options for providing energy in healthcare facilities
                and make
                related decisions. It provides important initial information
                before moving
                towards the project planning and implementation phases. And as
                such, it can
                reduce the time-intensive data collection and analysis efforts
                to identify
                the facilities and their needs. Once these are mapped out,
                there is no need
                to visit all facilities (but for some verification) and we
                (MoH) can assess
                the best way to provide energy either via solar systems or
                connecting to the
                grid.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Clean Cooking Explorer is crucial for rolling out projects for
                rural
                electrification. At the Rural Energy Agency in Tanzania we are
                going to use
                it in planning to realize the cost and the opportunities for
                expanding
                energy access. EAE will help REA move towards a more
                sophisticated way of
                planning.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                With Clean Cooking Explorer, you don’t need a GIS software to
                overlay a
                number of layers, such as solar potential, population density,
                network data
                and carry out analysis. All you need is an Internet browser.
                Stakeholders in
                the energy sector should make use of the platform to make
                informed decisions
                in the sector.
